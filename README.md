### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dillon Arnold and I am an aspiring software engineer! I grew up in Washington state my whole life before moving to Nebraska. While in school I always had dreams of becoming a commercial pilot! I did two years of ground school and actually had about 20 hours of flying to my name! I was able to pass all written exams, but wasnt sucessful on the medical exams due to an uncontrollable health condtion. 
<br> 
I then geared my learning towards finance and aquired my associates in accounting with intentions of getting my masters in financee. During that time I also found my love and passion for coding! 
<br> 
The challenge, the end result, and the content focus required drew me in! I am always up for a challenge and I love working my brain. With that I decided to enroll into TripleTens software engineering bootcamp to get me started! I figured it was a little late for a degree but have always loved learning and certainly see myself finished the last 2 years of college in CS if needed. 
<br> 
Here at Tripleten, thus far I have learned everything needed to be a front-end developer from HTML/CSS, Git and JavaScript as well as React.js. My learning isnt even close to done however. By the time Im done ill have 750+ hours in development both front-end and back-end! 
Thus far I have created multiple projects you can check out on my Github page. From fully responsive websites and a website using JavaScript! I am exciting to continue this passionate journey! 

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my career goals, as well as life goals! I love talking and would love to hear yours too! :)
