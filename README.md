### Hi there üëã

My name is Dillon Arnold and I am a full-stack engineer. I grew up in Washington state my whole life before moving to Nebraska. While in school I always had dreams of becoming a commercial pilot. I did two years of ground school and actually had about 20 hours of flying to my name. I was able to pass all written exams, but wasnt sucessful on the medical exams due to an uncontrollable health condtion. 
<br> 
I then geared my learning towards finance and aquired my associates in accounting with intentions of getting my masters in financee. During that time I also found my love and passion for coding! 
<br> 
The challenge, the end result, and the extreme focus required drew me in. I am always up for a challenge and I love working my brain. With that I decided to enroll into TripleTens software engineering bootcamp to get me started. At TripleTen I had accumulated 740+ hours of thoery and coding in stacks such as JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js MongoDB and Google Cloud. I am also proficient in Tailwind CSS and have gained exposure to SQL.
<br>
I have multiple front-end and full-stack applications that you can check out.
